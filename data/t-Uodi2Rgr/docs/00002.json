  "Content": "A national AI strategy, therefore, must provide nuanced guiding principles clearly defined and articulated in alignment with country values and goals, as well as ensure consistency with higher-order goals for the future of humanity and civilisation. It must provide a foundational baseline to catalyse homegrown innovations through intentional local capacity building and ecosystem enablement. It must also clarify the right incentive to overcome the hurdles to AI in local markets while emphasising shared societal benefits. It must attract high-impact strategic investment to drive breakthroughs, support national productivity and accelerate the creation and delivery of new or enhanced value for the good of all. ",
